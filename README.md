# gitchecker
will scan github pages


I created this to quickly scan github pages for trenching on solana. The scan takes under a minute depending on the size of the project you are scanning

Enter your api keys on line 13 and 15 

you can change the prompts on line 92 and 108 I played around with them but they could definitly be better 

when you run the program make sure to enter the repo as "/owner/repo"
